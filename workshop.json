  "Description": "This is a mod library. It contains tools common to several of my projects that I was sick of copying around (and which I shouldn't have been copying around to begin with).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't do anything on its own, but some mods depend on it. If you find something handy in there, feel free to depend on it too.\n\n[h2]Source[/h2]\r\nWant to see how it's made? There's a [url=https://github.com/UnderDoug/UD_Modding_Toolbox/]git repository[/url]!\r\n\r\nLicence is the \"Unlicence\". I don't know what that means, but I also don't care what you do with it. Easy.",
